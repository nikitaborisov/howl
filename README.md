# howl
Some calculations for the Howl at the Moon race.

`howl.py` generates an HTML file with how many loops you can finish at a given time and pace

`howl-rt.html` is a real-time Javascript page that calculates your current pace and predicts how much more you can run. Demo at http://nikita.ca/howl/
